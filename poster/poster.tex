    %Aspect ratio: For higher $\tilde{\beta}$ values the disk aspect ratio increases non-monotonicly. Values for $\tilde{\beta}=0.1,1.0,10.0$ are $h=0.05,0.055,0.08$. The values are not constant over time and make roughly parabolic shapes from intial planet formation to vortex death. The aspect ratio of the vortices themselves seem to be constantly near $h=0.05$ regardless of the cooling paramter. Also $\tilde{\beta}=5.0$ which has longest lifetime (2000+ orbits) corresponds to approximately $h=0.06$ which is similar result as Fu et al. 

    %Mach Number: Mach numbers generally in the vortex region of disk averaged aziumthally are $<0.4$ during semi-stable vortex state. Just as vortex dies out mach numbers drop to $M=0.2$ which are from the shock. Mach number near vortices during semi-stable state are near 0.2 from 2D plots.
    
    %Reynold's Stress:The averaged reynold's stress of the disk is usually of order $\alpha=10^{-2} - 10^{-3}$. During vortex death $\alpha=10^{-2}$ consistantly for all $\tilde{\beta}$ than drops to lower bound after vortex dissipation. Vortices themselves seem to have almost no characteristic reynolds stress associated with them from 2D plots.

    %Gap profile:After vortex death sees a distortion in outer gap depth and the outer gap edge slowly and continuously extends outwards. Gap edge in semi-steady state is around 5 hill radii (gap edges not very clear since current resolution isn't good). Changes in gap depth start before vortex dissaption and indicate that matter is moving inwards towards the planet. Supports notion that vortex distorts background profile. This effect increases largely during the dissipation phase

    %Vortex:The overdensiy of the vortex itself can reach 10 times the intial density of the disk. Vortex evolves from a large vortex to a highly dense small vortex. As it dies off the vortex distorts in shape most probably from interaction with shocks.Disapation time is around 50 orbits.
    
    %Rossby Numbers:Rossby numbers during semi-stable states are approximately around $Ro=-0.2$. Just after vortex amplitude drop, Rossby numbers increase to around $Ro=-0.4$ because of spreading of angular momentum from the once densly packed spinning vortex.

    %Non-linear Planet off:Long Term planet-off simulations do not show these drops in vortex amplitude. The vortices are of order of magnitude less in max amplitude and over time slowly decay assumingly by viscous friction. This supports fact that planet helps drive the interactions we are seeing. Results in progress.

                      Unstable disk-planet, leading to the
                      formation of large-scale vortices, has been
                      suggested to explain observations of transition
                      disks with lopsided dust
                      distributions. While theoretical disk-planet
                      models employed locally isothermal disks, 
                      the original linear theory of this vortex
                      instability was developed for adiabataic disks. We
                      generalize the study of planetary gap edge
                      instabilities to non-isothermal disks by
                      including an energy equation with variable
                      cooling rate, and study its effect on the
                      formation and evolution of gap-edge vortices.

              \justifying
             We numerically evolve the 2D fluid equations including a
             gap-opening giant planet, treated as an external
             potential on fixed circular orbit. We include in the
             energy equation  
        a simple source term in the form 
	\begin{align*}
	\frac{\partial e}{\partial t} = \cdots + \frac{e-e_{t=0}}{t_\mathrm{cool}},
	\end{align*}
        and $t_\mathrm{cool} = \beta \Omega_k^{-1}$, where $\Omega_k$
        is the Keplerian frequency. The energy density
        $e=p/(\gamma-1)$ where $p$ is the pressure field and
        $\gamma=1.4$ is the adiabatic index. We choose $\beta$ indirectly 
        through $\tilde{\beta}$ such that
        \begin{align*}
        t_\mathrm{cool, gap\,edge} = \tilde{\beta} t_\mathrm{lib, gap\,edge},
        \end{align*}
        where $t_\mathrm{lib, gap\,edge}$ is the time interval between
        successive encounters of a fluid element 
        located at the gap edge, and the planet's azimuth. Thus $\tilde{\beta}\ll 1$ implies that such a fluid returns to its initial temperature
        before passing by the planet again.
