\section{Summary and discussion}\label{summary}
In this paper, we have carried out numerical simulations of 








This non-monotonic behaviour of the vortex lifetime was also reported
by \cite{fu14}, who performed isothermal disc-planet 
simluations with different values of the disc aspect ratio.   
% Cooling rates with
% $\tilde\beta>5.0$ showed lifetimes that were well below the max
% lifetime. 
By analyzing the radial region around the vortex within $[2r_{h},10r_{h}]$
% {\bf define this region}
we find the 
$\tilde\beta=5.0$ case, with the longest vortex lifetime, has
$h\approx0.06$ on average throughout its lifetime. This value of $h$ was also
found to maximise vortex lifetimes in the simulations of
\cite{fu14}. Note that $h$ is a fixed parameter in \cite{fu14} while in
our simulations $h$ is a dynamical variable.
