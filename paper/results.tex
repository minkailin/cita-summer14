\section{Growth of non-axisymmetric modes without the influence of the
  planet}
%We first consider the linear stability of planetary gaps.  
In this section, the planet is introduced at $t=20P_0$ and 
its potential switched on over $10P_0$. At $t=30P_0$ we switch off the
planet potential and azimuthally average the surface density, energy
and velocity fields. At this point the planet has carved a partial
gap. We then perturb the density field and continue to 
evolve the disc. This procedure allows us to analyse the growth of
non-axisymmetric modes associated with the gap, but without
complications from non-axisymmetry arising directly from disk-planet
interaction.   

%The goal of these simulations is to compliment the disk-planet
%simluations presented later. 
These `planet-off' simulations are not linear stability calculations
because our cooling term restores the initial temperature profile
corresponding to $H/r=0.05$, rather than the heated gap edge.   

%disk-planet leads to heating 
%tcool tries to return it to the initial smooth profile (axisymmetric)
%if tcool > trwi -> temp returns to original value. heated gap not
%captured 

%There are two competing effects. Increasing
%$t_\mathrm{cool}$ leads to more heating and hence a larger sound-speed
%$c_s$, which favours instability \citep{li00} since the vortex
%instability is pressre-driven. However, gap-opening requires $r_h>H$,
%so increasing the sound-speed, and hence $H$, leads to a shallower
%gap (see below) and expected to be more stable. 

%tcool -> return to initial, t=0 temp. profile
%whereas the `basic state' is the gap profile with structured temp profile

%more details on perturbation: m=1 to 10, amplitude?  
%resolution?

\subsection{Gap structure}
{\bf plots of the gap structure before instability sets in, e.g. at
  t=30. surface density perturbation, gen. vortensity perturbation,
  aspect-ratio. compare diff. beta. gaps become more shallow with
  increasing cooling time (but not significantly - not enough time for
  full gap formation). generalized vortensity: extrema smoothed out
  with increasing cooling - expect more stability. aspect-ratio:
  significant heating. increase in H so expect larger vortices
}

\subsection{Linear modes and growth rates}
{\bf present `planet-off' simulations. one `fourier mode v.s. time'
  plot to show growth of linear instability. do an adiabatic case (or
  extremely long cooling time) to see the effect of heated gap edge
  (i.e. temp doesn't go back to t=0 value too quickly)
  compare growth rate and dominant
  m as function of beta (table). 2D figs to contrast (also used to
  show it's the minimum in generalized pv that goes unstable.    
  result: increasing cooling time makes the gap
  more stable, and favors lower m. note: the `basic state' should be
  the system at t=30 after azimuthal average. linear results should
  have small perturbations. 
}

\subsubsection{Nearly adiabatic disks}
{\bf a case with extrmely long cooling time (or adiabatic run) in
  order to look at effect of heated gap edge.  prelim result: not
  important, at t=30, gap edge only heats to $H/r\simeq0.06$ even for
  purely adiabatic disk. change in $h$ not important for linear
  perturbations (but important for setting up the basic state). 
}
%% We first describe results for weakly self-gravitating
%% discs $Q_0=8$ (giving $M_d=0.015M_*$) so that the gap remains 
%% gravitationally stable \citep{lin11b}. We also impose a dimensionless
%% kinematic viscosity $\hat{\nu}=2\times10^{-5}$ to suppress the Rossby
%% vortex instablity \citep{valborro07}. These parameter values
%% are typical for disc-planet simulations and yield stable/steady 
%% gap profiles. This will be useful reference cases to  
%% understand the unstable cases considered later.  

%% Fig. \ref{lvisc_steady_gap} shows the steady state gap profiles in terms of the relative
%% surface density and aspect-ratio at $t=200P_0$. Three levels of cooling are considered:
%% $\tbeta=0.1,\,1.0$ and $10.0$ (i.e. $t_c\Omega_k\simeq2.4,\,24$ and $240$). We refer to them as
%% fast, moderate and slow cooling cases, respectively. 

\section{Non-linear evolution of
  gap-edge vortices with finite cooling time} 
{\bf main fig: vortex amplitude v.s. time for diff beta. enough data
  to plot vortex lifetime v.s. beta? table: 
  averaged quantities over quasi-steady state: aspect-ratio (to
  compare with fu at al), rossby number (vortex strength
  v.s. cooling?), maybe alpha visc. vortex size: visible difference?  
  only inviscid cases. describe evolution of one case. main
  conclusion: longer vortex lifetime with increasing cooling time (up
  to some optimal timescale). vortex death: induced-shock and/or
  smoothing the gap edge. describe simulation setup, resolution?
  should mention that results consistent with lower-resolution prelim
  runs. maybe torques? 
}

Long term simulation of vortices were done for $\tilde{\beta}=0.1,1.0$ and
 $\hat{\nu}=10^{-6},10^{-8},10^{-9}$ up to a total of 2000 orbits. Values
 of higher $\tilde{\beta}$ resulted generally in longer vortex lifetimes.
 The inviscid cases also were characterized by a sudden death of vortices
 while the higher viscosity case showed a gradual decrease in mode amplitudes
 attributed to the vortices.

Short term simulations of the linear phase of instability growth also distinguished
 the different effects of cooling rates. Simulations with higher
 $\tilde{\beta}$ were characterized by slower growth rates centered at the
 $m=2$ mode, lower density pertibations and vortex locations, and a more unitary aspect
 ratio for the vortices.

%%\section{Gaps in massive discs (MKL)}
%% We first examine disc models with $Q_o=1.5$. We set the physical
%% viscosity $\hat{\nu}=10^{-9}$, so that the only energy source is
%% through shock-heating (via artificial viscosity) and the $\mathcal{C}$
%% function when $e\Sigma<e_i\Sigma_i$. The numerical resolution is
%% $N_r\times N_\phi = 512\times 1024$.   

%% %Since we are primarily concerened with gap stability, it is important
%% %to first examine the gap structured opened by the planet as a function
%% %of cooling. 
%% Fig. \ref{gvort1d_q1d5} compares the gap structure in terms of the GV profile for three
%% levels of cooling: $\tilde{\beta}=0.1$, $\tilde{\beta}=1$ and
%% $\tbeta=10$. For convenience we will refer to these cases as fast,
%% intermediate and slow cooling, respectively. The snapshot is taken at
%% $t=30P_0$, just after the planet is fully introduced. 

%% In terms of the GV profile, the qualitative features of the planetary
%% gap --- localized GV extrema at the gap edges --- remain unchanged
%% despite two orders of magnitude difference in the cooling rate.
