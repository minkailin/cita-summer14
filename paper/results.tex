\section{Gaps in low mass viscous discs}

We first describe results for weakly self-gravitating
discs $Q_0=8$ (giving $M_d=0.015M_*$) so that the gap remains 
gravitationally stable \citep{lin11b}. We also impose a dimensionless
kinematic viscosity $\hat{\nu}=2\times10^{-5}$ to suppress the Rossby
vortex instablity \citep{valborro07}. These parameter values
are typical for disc-planet simulations and yield stable/steady 
gap profiles. This will be useful reference cases to  
understand the unstable cases considered later.  

Fig. \ref{lvisc_steady_gap} shows the steady state gap profiles in terms of the relative
surface density and aspect-ratio at $t=200P_0$. Three levels of cooling are considered:
$\tbeta=0.1,\,1.0$ and $10.0$ (i.e. $t_c\Omega_k\simeq2.4,\,24$ and $240$). We refer to them as
fast, moderate and slow cooling cases, respectively.

\section{Gaps in massive discs}
We first examine disc models with $Q_o=1.5$. We set the physical
viscosity $\hat{\nu}=10^{-9}$, so that the only energy source is
through shock-heating (via artificial viscosity) and the $\mathcal{C}$
function when $e\Sigma<e_i\Sigma_i$. The numerical resolution is
$N_r\times N_\phi = 512\times 1024$.   

%Since we are primarily concerened with gap stability, it is important
%to first examine the gap structured opened by the planet as a function
%of cooling. 
Fig. \ref{gvort1d_q1d5} compares the gap structure in terms of the GV profile for three
levels of cooling: $\tilde{\beta}=0.1$, $\tilde{\beta}=1$ and
$\tbeta=10$. For convenience we will refer to these cases as fast,
intermediate and slow cooling, respectively. The snapshot is taken at
$t=30P_0$, just after the planet is fully introduced. 

In terms of the GV profile, the qualitative features of the planetary
gap --- localized GV extrema at the gap edges --- remain unchanged
despite two orders of magnitude difference in the cooling rate.
