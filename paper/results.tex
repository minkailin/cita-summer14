\section{Gaps in low mass discs (RL)}

%% We first describe results for weakly self-gravitating
%% discs $Q_0=8$ (giving $M_d=0.015M_*$) so that the gap remains 
%% gravitationally stable \citep{lin11b}. We also impose a dimensionless
%% kinematic viscosity $\hat{\nu}=2\times10^{-5}$ to suppress the Rossby
%% vortex instablity \citep{valborro07}. These parameter values
%% are typical for disc-planet simulations and yield stable/steady 
%% gap profiles. This will be useful reference cases to  
%% understand the unstable cases considered later.  

%% Fig. \ref{lvisc_steady_gap} shows the steady state gap profiles in terms of the relative
%% surface density and aspect-ratio at $t=200P_0$. Three levels of cooling are considered:
%% $\tbeta=0.1,\,1.0$ and $10.0$ (i.e. $t_c\Omega_k\simeq2.4,\,24$ and $240$). We refer to them as
%% fast, moderate and slow cooling cases, respectively. 

Long term simulation of vortices were done for $\tilde{\beta}=0.1,1.0$ and
 $\hat{\nu}=10^{-6},10^{-8},10^{-9}$ up to a total of 2000 orbits. Values
 of higher $\tilde{\beta}$ resulted generally in longer vortex lifetimes.
 The inviscid cases also were characterized by a sudden death of vortices
 while the higher viscosity case showed a gradual decrease in mode amplitudes
 attributed to the vortices.

Short term simulations of the linear phase of instability growth also distinguished
 the different effects of cooling rates. Simulations with higher
 $\tilde{\beta}$ were characterized by slower growth rates centered at the
 $m=2$ mode, lower density pertibations and vortex locations, and a more unitary aspect
 ratio for the vortices.

%%\section{Gaps in massive discs (MKL)}
%% We first examine disc models with $Q_o=1.5$. We set the physical
%% viscosity $\hat{\nu}=10^{-9}$, so that the only energy source is
%% through shock-heating (via artificial viscosity) and the $\mathcal{C}$
%% function when $e\Sigma<e_i\Sigma_i$. The numerical resolution is
%% $N_r\times N_\phi = 512\times 1024$.   

%% %Since we are primarily concerened with gap stability, it is important
%% %to first examine the gap structured opened by the planet as a function
%% %of cooling. 
%% Fig. \ref{gvort1d_q1d5} compares the gap structure in terms of the GV profile for three
%% levels of cooling: $\tilde{\beta}=0.1$, $\tilde{\beta}=1$ and
%% $\tbeta=10$. For convenience we will refer to these cases as fast,
%% intermediate and slow cooling, respectively. The snapshot is taken at
%% $t=30P_0$, just after the planet is fully introduced. 

%% In terms of the GV profile, the qualitative features of the planetary
%% gap --- localized GV extrema at the gap edges --- remain unchanged
%% despite two orders of magnitude difference in the cooling rate.
