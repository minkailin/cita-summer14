%Hydrodynamic simulations of self-gravitating disc-planet interactions are presented. 
Several observations of transition discs show lopsided
dust-distributions. This is suggestive of a dust-trapping mechanism at work. A
popular explanation is the formation of a large-scale vortex at the
edge of a gap opened by a giant planet. While theoretical models
support this picture, numerical simluations have thus far
employed locally isothermal discs. On the other hand, the theory of the
vortex-forming instability was originally developed for adiabatic
discs. We generalise the study of planetary gap stability to non-isothermal
discs using customised numerical simulations of disc-planet
systems. We include in the energy equation a cooling term with cooling
timescale $t_\mathrm{cool}=\beta\Omega_k^{-1}$, where $\Omega_k$ is
the Keplerian frequency, and examine the effect of $\beta$ on the
stability of gap edges. For measurments reminsent of linear stability, gap edges stabilize with increasing $\beta$ as dominate modes and growth rates decrease in value. In the non-linear limit of planet-vortex interactions, large scale overdense vortices were found to last for 1000's of orbits in a quasi-steady state characterized by sudden disspation on the order of 100's or planet orbits. Vortex lifetimes were found to have a non-monoticly dependence on $\beta$ and an optimum value for cooling rate was found to maximize the lifetime. 

%The simulations are customized to examine the stability of gaps opened by massive planets as a function of $\beta$.

\section{Introduction}\label{intro}
{
\bf 
observational motivation: asymmetric dust distributions. 
theoretical motivations: generalize gap stability to include energy equation. 
}

Disk-planet interaction plays an important role in the theory of planet formation and has been invoked to explain 
sub-structures obsererved in transition disks. It is well-known that a sufficiently massive planet opens a disk gap, and
such structures have been detected. A more recent theoretical result is that planetary gaps are dynamically unstable under
certain conditions. The so-called Rossby wave instability operates in radially structured disks, and leads 
to vortex-formation. 

In this work, we extend the study of planetary gap stability against vortex formation to non-isothermal discs. 
We include a fluid energy equation in the hydrodynamical equations describing disk-planet systems. We consider a simple
cooling function and examine the effect cooling rate on the stability of planetary gaps.
